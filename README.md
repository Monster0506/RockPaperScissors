# ROCK PAPER SCISSCORS

A very simple implementation of the [`rock, paper scissors`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors) game.

- Written in [`python`](https://python.org) to demonstrate the use of a [`lookup table`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookup_table).
- Also written with [`match`](https://peps.python.org/pep-0634/) statements, which are pretty new, and somewhat interesting.
